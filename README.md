# Tic Tac Toe game

## Technologies
HTML, SCSS, JS, JQuery, and Ajax

## Development Process
- Read project requirements and API documentation
- Used suggested schedule as a guide for sectioning out the project (planning > game engine, authentication, game ui, game api)
- Created wireframes and user stories

Game Engine
- Wrote pseudo code to define each step
- Used console.log to confirm new lines of code work as indended
- Set up game logic to produce code in format that matches API requirements (but not connected to API yet)
- Add x or o (as text) to game array based on input
- Add input validation and win/draw conditions
- Update visual game board based on input
- Have game logic working locally

User Authentication
- Checked API with CURL scripts, then created functions to send data to API
- Created forms to input data and send to API
- Create success and fail conditions for each API action

Game UI
- Update x/o from text to image file
- Hide certain modules/forms based on sign-in status
- Add CSS to refine visual layout

Game API
- Checked API with CURL scripts, then created functions to send data to API
- Connect game play to API (update each move to server)
- Create function to generate table to show list of games associated with a user

## Problem Solving:
- Used multiple console.logs to determine where code was breaking
- Created to-do list of features to work on, issues
- Simplified issues by breaking it down into smaller tasks (and writing them down)
- Focused on solving current issue and not jumping around on tasks
- Opened GitHub issue on the project repo for instructor's help when googling for references and solutions did not yield desired results
- Committed code often, after each small task is resolved

## Future iterations
- Multiplayer functionality
- Play against the computer
- Cleaner SCSS
- UI animations

## Wireframes & User stories
Wireframes: <link>
User stories:
As a user, I want to:
      easily start a new game
      play with another person
      save a record of the games I've played
      play against the computer as an opponent
